# Gradle & Kotlin

This is a template for a Gradle project using Kotlin.

## How to use

### Easy way

Click the "Use this template" button on the top right of this page.

### Other platforms

Download the zip file from the "Clone or download" button on the top right of this page.

## Getting started

1. Modify the `settings.gradle` file to change the root project name
2. Create a new module by creating a new directory in the `projects` directory and adding a `build.gradle` file to it.
3. Add the module to the `settings.gradle` file.

## Adding plugins

If you need to add a gradle plugin that is only used in a single module, you can add it to the `build.gradle` file in that module. Otherwise please add it to the root `build.gradle` file with `apply: false` and then in your module at the top of the `build.gradle` file add a `plugins` block with your dependency, you will only need to supply the name of it.

## Adding dependencies

We recommend adding versions inside the `gradle.properties` file and then referencing them in the `build.gradle` files. This makes it easier to update versions in the future.

## Directory structure

- [docs](/docs): Contains project documentation for example `.md` or `.html` files.
- [docker](/docker): If your project uses docker it makes sense to add `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`s here.
- [projects](/projects): Here you add all of the modules for your project, i.e. folders with `build.gradle`.
